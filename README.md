# eye-exercise

## Description
This is a programming exercise for creating two animated eyeballs on the screen. Each eyeball is programmed to follow the user's mouse pointer as it moves across the screen. I created two different pages for this app.
 1.) A basic version, showing the basic requirements for this exercise, which forces both eyes to move dependently of, or in exact positional synchronicity with, each other. 
 2.) A "Frog Eyes" version, which allows each eyeball to move independently of the other. This way, it's possible to make them go cross-eyed, because c'mon, who doesn't want to see an animated frog go cross-eyed? 

## Installation / Usage
Download all of the files within this repository, and load the index.html file in a web browser. This app can run while hosted either locally or on a remote web server. For a live preview, you can run the index.html file in this repo, directly, by visting this URL: https://mdiaconescu.github.io/eye-exercise/index.html

## Roadmap
- On the "Frog Eyes" screen, I would like to add an animated fly (or dragonfly) that randomly flies around the screen, and the frog's eye will automatically follow it.
